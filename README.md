## About The Project

This project is a sample project for creating a VS Code plugin with a hexagonal software architecture.

### Built With

* [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [Tsyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe)
* [VSCode API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/peterhnm/vscode-hexagonal-example.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```
3. Build the project
   ```shell
   yarn build
   ```
4. Run the project in VS Code
   ```shell
   code .
   ```
   Press `F5` to run the project in debug mode.
   Within the **_Extension Host_** open the [example](example) folder.

## Documentation

   <em>The application's rough software architecture</em>
</p>

I am using the Hexagonal Architecture as described by *Tom Hombergs* in his book
[Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture](https://www.packtpub.com/product/get-your-hands-dirty-on-clean-architecture/9781839211966).  
The plugin is an example of a [*CustomTextEditor*](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors)
which reacts on `.hexagon` files.

As you can see in the diagram above, the application is divided into:

* **Input-Adapters** *"drive"* our application. In the case of a VS Code plugin, these are mainly user inputs.
* **Services** contain the business logic of our application. They are the core of our application.
* **Output-Adapters** are *"driven"* by our application to communicate with the outside world.
  In the case of a VS Code plugin, this is the VS Code API itself.

**The application core, which contains the ports and services, has no dependencies on the VS Code API.**

* [Scenarios](docs/Scenarios.md)
